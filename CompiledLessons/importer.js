Modern JavaScript isn't technically called JavaScript, it's real name is ECMAScript.\nHowever, for simplicity we will refer to it as JavaScript from now on.\n\n## Why JavaScript?\nJavaScript is crucial for both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, it enhances user experiences by enabling dynamic content and interactive features, such as real-time updates and animations. On the backend, environments like Node.js allow JavaScript to build efficient server-side applications, making it an essential tool for full-stack development.\n\n\n", "# Basics of JavaScript\n\nJavascript is used with HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are coding languages that allow you to structure and style websites, while javascript runs more complex, logic-based actions on your website. \n\nYou can call Javascript code by using the `<script>` tag. \n\nExample:\n\n```html\n<script>\n    document.getElementById(\"example\").innerHTML = \"Programming with JavaScript!\";\n</script>\n```\nYou can place scripts anywhere in an HTML file -- it could be at the head, body, or any div. Here's an example of the script we made above being used in a standard HTML file.\n\nTry it out!\n\n```html\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n\n<head>\n    <script> \n    \n    function changeParagraph() {\n        document.getElementById(\"example\").innerHTML = \"Programming with JavaScript!\";\n    }\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1> programming with javascript is fun! </h1>\n\n    <button type=\"button\" onclick=\"changeParagraph()\">try it out!</button>\n\n    <p id=\"example\">Coding with HTML...</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nIn this example, a function will be called when the user presses on a button, which will change the paragraph text to \"programming with JavaScript!\"\n\n## Calling JavaScript Code Externally\n\nYou can also place scripts in seperate files. For example, the following code can be placed in a different file named `script.js`:\n\n```js\nfunction coolFunction() {\n    document.getElementById(\"cool code\").innerHTML = \"Programming with JavaScript!\";\n}\n```\n\nTo run this code in your `index.html` file, you can place it in the HTML file with the script tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n```\n", "# Outputting JavaScript\n\nSo far, we've learned how to output some code with innerHTML, like this:\n\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n\n<head>\n    <script> \n    \n    function changeParagraph() {\n        document.getElementById(\"example\").innerHTML = \"Programming with JavaScript!\";\n    }\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1> programming with javascript is fun! </h1>\n\n    <button type=\"button\" onclick=\"changeParagraph()\">try it out!</button>\n\n    <p id=\"example\">Coding with HTML...</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nHowever, there are many different ways to output JavaScript code.\n\nOne way is to use document.write(), which is helpful for testing out your code. Here is how you can use it in HTML:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n\n    <h1> cool website! </h1>\n\n    <script>\n        document.write(1 + 1); // should equal 2.\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nThe addition done in the brackets will show up on the page as 2. \n\nAnother way to show output in JavaScript is with window.alert(). This can be helpful to display data in an alert box.\n\nExample:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n\n    <h1> cool website! </h1>\n\n    <script>\n        window.alert(1 + 1); // should equal 2.\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe final way to output data is through console.log(). We will use this as our main way to output data in later lessons. It's helpful for debugging your code, and displays your data in the console or terminal, not on the document. \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n\n    <h1> cool website! </h1>\n\n    <script>\n        console.log(1 + 1); // should equal 2.\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```", "# Variables, Syntax, and Comments\n\nA variable in programming is a container that holds a specific value, that may or may not change. Variables are necessary for any program you are creating, so it is essential you understand the different types of variables and when to use them.\n\n\n## Statements\na statement in programming is a programming instruction that tells the computer what to do. Declaring and initializing a variable is a type of statement.\n\nStatements are composed of:\n\n- values\n- operators\n- expressions\n- keywords\n- comments\n\nSemicolons seperate statements from each other.\n\nTo declare variables, JavaScript uses `var`, `const`, and `let`. An equal sign is used to assign values to your variable. \n\nExample:\n\n```js\nlet foo, bar, sum; // declaring a variable -- setting up the container.\nfoo = 90; // place the value 90 into the container 'foo'\nbar = 22; // place the value 22 into the container 'bar'\nsum = foo + bar; // add the values of foo and bar together and place the value in the container 'sum'. \nconsole.log(sum) // prints out the value of sum to the console. much easier than typing foo + bar, right?\n```\nThe green highlighted text is what is known as a comment. It is text that the computer ignores, and is written for other people who are reading your code to understand it better. it's also helpful for when you want to come back to a project after a long time of not working on it. Comments make your life and others' easier. \n\nTo create a single-line comment, use `// text`. To create a multi-line comment, use:\n\n```js\n/* comment\nis \nmultiline\nhow fun\n*/\n```\n\nThe example above from earlier also uses JavaScript Operators, like arithmetic operators:\n\n- `+` to add\n- `-` to subtract\n- `*` to multiply\n- `/` to divide.\n\nhere's an example of all the different arithmetic operators used together: \n```js\n\nlet a, b, c, d, e;\na = 4 + 2;\nb = a - 3;\nc = b * a;\nd = c / 2;\ne = a + b + c + d;\nconsole.log(e);\n```\n\n### Const vs. let\nVariables with const cannot be redeclared or ressaigned. This may be helpful when you want a constant that cannot be mutable. \n\nconst variables are capitalized to seperate them from mutable variables. \nExample:\n\n```js\n// hooke's law:\nconst K = 50;\nlet d = 2;\nlet springForce = -(K * d);\n\nconsole.log(springForce);\n```\nconst variablse CANNOT be assigned like this:\n\n```js\nconst K;\nK = 50;\n```\nit must be assigned and declared on the same line.\n\nUse CONST when you declare a new object,  function, or array.\n", "# JavaScript Data Types\n\nJavaScript has 8 Datatypes:\n\n- Strings\n- Numbers\n- BigInt\n- Booleans\n- Undefined\n- Null\n- Symbol\n- Objects\n\nExamples of data types:\n\n```js\n\n// numbers\n\nlet age = 16;\nlet priceOfHotDogs = 7002832.32;\n\n// Strings\nlet name = \"jimmy\";\n\n// Booleans\n\nlet goodAtValorant = true;\nlet goodGrades = false;\n\n// Object:\n\nconst student = {name: \"Jim Bob\", city: \"GenericTown\"}\n\n// date object:\n\nconst dateToday = new Date(\"2015-04-14\")\n\n```"]};

You may use Python for web development, software development, mathematics, and data analysis! \n\n## Why Python?\n\nPython works on virtually every platform and its syntax is as if you're speaking english. This syntax, in particular, permits for new programmers such as yourself to write programs in a significantly lesser amount of lines. Later on in your computer science journey, you'll realize that optimization versus lines in code are NOT linearly associated with each other. However, for simplicity's sake, optimization and complexity will be out of the scope of your learning.\n\nRun your first python statement: \n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nAs you can see, the \"print\" function will display text to the screen.\nIt's important to encase the text with double quotes \"\", otherwise you will get an error.\nYou will learn more about python's syntax in future lessons.", "# Syntax\nLearn how to indent and use python syntax properly\n\nPython syntax can get tedious due to indentation. Spaces are important!\n\nWhen programming in other languages, indentation is only for **readability**. However, in the python programming language, indentation is **essential**.\nYou may use either 2 or 4 spaces to indent your code, but you must keep the spacing consistent.\n\n## Example:\n\nWorking code:\n```python\nif 1 + 1 is 2:\n    print(\"Indents are important\")\n```\nBad code:\n```python\nif 1 + 1 is 2:\nprint(\"This does not work\")\n```\n\n## Comments\nComments are used to explain your code to whoever is reading it. The computer ignores the comment when executing the code. \n\n## Example:\n\n```py\n# this is comment, it will not be printed\nprint(\"This will be printed!\")\n```\n\nMulti-line comments can be done by using a multiline string. Python will ignore strings that aren't assigned to anything, meaning it will ignore the string and will count as a comment. \n\n## Example:\n\n```py\n\"\"\"\nthis is a \nmultiline\ncomment. \n\"\"\"\nprint(\"This will be printed.\")\n```", "# Variables\nLearn how to create and identify variables\n\n## What exactly is a variable? \n\nSimply put, it's a way to store information. In the case of python, there's no actual function or command to declare a variable. \n\nEvery single time you assign a value to a \"word\" or \"variable\" then the variable is created.\nExample:\n```python\nx = 1\nprint(x)\n```\nVariables, as you can see, do not need to be declared with any \"type\". Their \"type\" can be changed any time.\nExample:\n```python\nx = 1\nx = \"Tree\"\nprint(x)\n```\n## How can we identify what type of variable are we dealing with?\nWell, it's quite simple. We use the **type()** function. There are four variable types that we will be looking at:\n* Strings\n* Integers\n* Floats\n* Booleans\n\n## Try it out here:\n```python\nsvar = \"Tree\"\nivar = 5\nfvar = 5.0\nbvar = True\nprint(type(svar))\nprint(type(ivar))\nprint(type(fvar))\nprint(type(bvar))\n```\n\n\n## Variable Names\nNaming your variables properly is a good practice, so you can save you and whoever's reading your code time and effort. The general rules for naming variables in python are:\n\n- A variable name has to start with a *letter* or an underscore (it cannot start with a number!)\n- It cannot contain any symbols (#@!$%^&*.. etc)\n- Variable names are case-sensitive!\n\n\nTry running these illegal variable names:\n\n```py\nqarTo$ = 18.2\n3rdmonth = \"March\"\nif = true\nthird-month = \"March\"\nprint(qarTo$)\nprint(if)\nprint(3rdmonth)\nprint(third-month)\n```\n\nExample of Case-sensitive variable names:\n```py\nparkName = \"generic park\"\nParkName = \"dilly dallying in generic park\"\nPARKNAME = \"generic park 2\"\npaRKnAmE = \"non-generic park\"\nparkname = \"very generic park\"\n\nprint(parkName)\nprint(ParkName)\nprint(PARKNAME)\nprint(paRKnAmE)\nprint(parkname)\n```\n", "# Numeric Types\nLearn how to represent numbers\n\n## What are numeric types?\n\nNumeric Types are a type of data type that is used to represent and manipulate numic values, these can be in the form of whole numbers, integers, and decimals.\n\n## Integers\nIntegers are represented through the (int) data type that represents whole numbers and integers.\n\n```python\na = 10 # Positive Integers\nb = -5 # Negative Integer\nc = 0 # Zero\nprint(a)\nprint(b)\nprint(c)\n```\n## Floating points\nRepresented through the (float) data type, they represent decimal numbers and always have a decimal point.\n\n```python\npi = 3.14\nshares = -5.9\nprint(pi)\nprint(shares)\n```\n\n## Complex Numbers\nRepresenting imaginary numbers, complex is a more unique data type, that can be separated by real and imaginary using the (.real) and (.imag) methods.\n\n```python\nimag_function = 3 + 4j\nprint(imag_function.real)\nprint(imag_function.imag)\n```", "# Casting\nLearn how to convert between data types\n\n## What is casting?\n\nCasting means to specify the type on a variable, utilizing classes to designate and define data types, including its primitive types.\n\nCasting in python uses constructor functions.\n\nint() - Creates an integer numeral from an integer interal, a float literal (which removes all decimals), or a string literal (provided that the string is a whole number)\n\nfloat() - Creates a float numeral from an integer literal (which adds the .0 decimal points), a float literal, or a string literal (provided that the string constitutes an integer or float)\n\nstr() - Creates a string from a variety of data types, including from an integer interal, a float literal, or a string literal\n\nNOTE: Using int() and float() to cast a non-numerical value will result in an error, str() will result in both numerical and non-numerical values to String values\n\n## int() example\n```python\na = int(8) # a will equal 8\nb = int(12.3) # b will equal 12\nc = int(\"15\") # c will equal 15\nd = int(\"17.56\") # d will equal 17\nf = int(\"Fractal Tree\") # This will result in an error\n```\n\n## float() example\n```python\na = float(8) # a will equal 8.0\nb = float(12.3) # b will equal 12.3\nc = float(\"15\") # c will equal 15.0\nd = float(\"17.56\") # d will equal 17.56\nf = float(\"Fractal Tree\") # This will result in an error\n```\n\n## str() example\n```python\na = str(8) # a will equal '8'\nb = str(12.3) # b will equal '12.3'\nc = str(\"15\") # c will equal '15'\nd = str(\"17.56\") # d will equal '17.56'\nf = str(\"Fractal Tree\") # f will equal 'Fractal Tree'\n```", "# String Manipulation\nLearn how to manipulate text\n\n## String Indexes\n\nStrings have an index assigned towards each character that starts from 0 onwards. \n\nThis is used to replicate a range of characters in a given string.\n\n### Slicing\nUtilizing a given start and end index will allow to print a specific set of characters in a string.\n\nNOTE: Slicing will result in the printed string to include the starting index but no the ending index\n\n```python\ne = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(e:[1:8]) # Will print characters from the 1st index to the 4th index: 'ractal '\n```\n\n### Slice from the start \nBy leaving out the start index, the range will start from the first character to the designated end index given.\n\n```python\ne = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(e[:3]) # Will print characters from the start to the 5th index: 'Fra'\n```\n\n### Slice to the end\nBy leaving out the end index, the range will start from designated index given to the end of the string.\n\n```python\ne = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(e:[3:]) # Will print characters from the 3rd index to the end: 'ctal Tree'\n```\n\n## String Modification\nPython has built in methods that aid in modifying string values in the process of changing the characters in the string\n\nThe upper() method returns all characters in the string in upper case:\n```python\nf = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(f.upper()) # Returns 'FRACTAL TREE'\n```\n\nThe lower() method returns all characters in the string in lower case:\n```python\nf = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(f.lower()) # Returns 'fractal tree'\n```\n\nThe replace() method replaces a string or specific character with another string:\n```python\nf = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(f.replace(\"al\",\"ion\")) # Returns 'Fraction Tree'\n```\n## String Concatenation\nUsing the + operator, you can concatenate or combine 2 different strings\n\nMerging 2 strings:\n```python\ng = \"Fractal\"\nh = \"Tree\"\nprint(g + h) # Will print 'FractalTree'\n```\n\nYou can also print extra strings such as spaces between stored variables using the + operator:\n```python\ng = \"Fractal\"\nh = \"Tree\"\nprint(g + \" \" + h) # Will print 'Fractal Tree'\n```", "# Python Operators\nWhat is an operator?\n\nAn operator is used in python to execute operations on given and/or created variables and values.\n\nWe've already discussed the '+' operator that can concatenate strings, but it can also perform arithmetic and math equations when used on int values and float values.\n\n```python\nint math = (9 + 10)\nprint(math)\n```\n\nIn this lesson, we will discuss:\n- Arithmetic Operators\n- Assignment Operators\n- Comparision Operators\n- Logical Operators\n\n## Arithmetic Operators\n\nWe've already discussed the + operator, so of course, there has to be an operator for subtracting values, like the - operator\n\n```python\nprint(6 - 4) # Will print 2\nprint(1.2 - 0.8) 3 # Will print 0.4\nprint(35 - 10.4) # Will print 24.6\n```\n\nThere is also multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), and exponentialism (**).\n\nUsing (*) will result in the multiplication of the values used.\n\nUsing (/) will result in the division of the values used.\n\nUsing (%) will result in printing the remainder of the result of devising the dividend by the divisor (NOTE: If the divisor is 0, it will result in an error, and 0 also counts as a multiple of any number, so if the dividend is less than the divisor, it will return the dividend [assuming if both are dividend is positive])\n\nUsing (**) will make the second value act as an exponent towards the first value \n\n```python\nprint(5*2) # Will print 10\nprint(2.5*3) # Will print 7.5\n\nprint(100/25) # Will print 4\nprint(27.0/6) # Will print 4.5\n\nprint(10%3) # Will print 1\nprint(16%4) # Will print 0\nprint(2%3) # Will print 2\n\nprint(2**5) # Will print 32 (same as 2*2*2*2*2)\n```\n\n## Assignment Operators\n\nThis kind of operator is utilized to assign values to variables.\n\nExample of (=):\n```python\nx = 5\n```\n\nExample of (+=):\n```python\nx += 5 # Same as x = x + 5\n```\n\nExample of (-=):\n```python\nx -= 5 # Same as x = x - 5\n```\n\nExample of (*=):\n```python\nx *= 5 # Same as x = x * 5\n```\n\nExample of (/=):\n```python\nx /= 5 # Same as x = x / 5\n```\n\nExample of (**=):\n```python\nx **= 5 # Same as x = x ** 5\n```\n\nExample of (:=)\n```python\nx := 5 # Same as x = 5 ; print(x)\n```\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\nComparison operators are used to compare 2 or more different values and/or variables:\n\nEqual operator (==):\nUsed to indicate that 2 values are equal.\n```python\na == b # Literally means a is equal to b\n```\n\nNot equal operator (!=):\nUsed to indicate that 2 values are not equal.\n```python\na != b # Literally means a is not equal to b\n```\n\nGreater than and Greater than or equal to operator (>) and (>=):\nUsed to indicate the the first value is greater than the other OR that the first value is greater than or equal to the other\n```python\na > b # Literally means a is greater than b\nc >= d # Literally means c is greater than or equal to d\n```\n\nLesser than and Lesser than or equal to operator (<) and (<=):\nUsed to indicate the the first value is lesser than the other OR that the first value is lesser than or equal to the other\n```python\na < b # Literally means a is lesser than b\nc <= d # Literally means c is lesser than or equal to d\n```\n\n## Logical Operators\n\nLogical Operators are used to combine conditional statements and are mostly used for selection and iteration in python.\n\n(or) Operator: When used, it will return True when either or both values is true, otherwise it will return False\n(and) Operator: When used, it will return True when both values are true, otherwise it will return False\n(not) Operator: Reverses the outcome of the operation, when used, returns False if the outcome is True, and vice-versa.\n\n```python\n\nx = 6\ny = 4\nz = 10\n\nx > y or z < y # Returns True as at least one of the outcomes is True\n\nx > y and z < y # Returns False as both are not true\n\nnot(x > y) # Returns False even though x > y is true, but it returns False due to the outcome reversal\n```", "# Booleans and Logical Operators\nLearn how to represent true and false values\n\n## Boolean Operators and Values\nIn programming, especially python, it's important to know if an expression is true or false.\nEvaluating a boolean expression in python will only give two answers: True, and False.\nComparing two values will evaluate the expression to a boolean response.\n\n```python\nprint(12 > 4) # 12 is greater than 4, evaluates to True\nprint(12 < 4) # 12 is less than 4, evaluates to False\nprint(12 == 4) # 12 is equal to 4, evaluates to False\nprint(12 >= 12) # 12 is greater than or equal to 12, evaluates to True\nprint(12 <= 4) # 12 is less than or equal to 4, evaluates to False\n```\n\n## Selection\nSelection in python consists of the use of if  statements, which print messages based on whether a condition or parameter is true or false\n\n```python\nk = 42\nd = 90\n\nif k > d:\n  print(\"k is greater than d\") # False condition, will resolve to the else statement\nelse:\n  print(\"k is not greater than d\") # True condition, it will print this string\n```\n\nThere are more operators such as || and &&, which both compare at least two different conditions.\n\nor is the equivalent to suiting at least 1 condition, so if at least one condition or any other are met, it will evaluate to a true statement, if neither are true, then it will evaluate to false.\n\nand is the equivalent to suiting all conditions, so if all conditions are met, then it will evaluate to true, if not all or neither are met, than it will evaluate to false.\n\n```python\n\nk = 42\nd = 90\no = 42\nt = 75\n\nprint(k >= d or k == o) # k is equal to d or k is equal to o, k is equal to o, so the statement evaluates to True\nprint(k >= d and k == o) # k is equal to d or k is equal to o, k is equal to o, but k is not greater than or equal to d, since at least both conditions are not met, the statement evaluates to False\nprint(k == o and t < d) # k is equal to o and t is less than d, so since both conditions are met, this statement evaluates to True\n\nif k <= o and d > t: # Both conditions are met, so this will print 'I love pizza!'\n    print(\"I love pizza!\") \nelse:\n    print(\"I love burgers!\")\n\nif d <= o and t > k: # At least one condition is met, so this will print 'I love ice cream!'\n    print(\"I love ice cream!\") \nelse:\n    print(\"I love cake!\")\n```\n"]};
